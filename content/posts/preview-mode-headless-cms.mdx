# Setting Up Chezmoi and Pushing Config Files to Bitbucket to Share Across Systems Using Zsh

In this article, we'll discuss how to set up `chezmoi`, a tool for managing your dotfiles, and how to push your configuration files to a Bitbucket repository to share them across multiple systems. We'll be using the Zsh shell for this tutorial. 

## Step 1: Install Chezmoi

The first step is to install `chezmoi`. You can install it using your favorite package manager, or you can install it directly from the command line with this command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)"
```

## Step 2: Initialize Chezmoi

Once `chezmoi` is installed, you need to initialize it by running the command:

```bash
chezmoi init
```

This command creates a new git repository in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` where `chezmoi` will store its source state [Source 1](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/).

## Step 3: Add Dotfiles to Chezmoi

Next, you need to add the dotfiles you wish to manage with `chezmoi`. You can use the `chezmoi add` command for this. If you want to add a whole folder, use the `-r` argument after `add`.

```bash
chezmoi add ~/.zshrc
```

This command will copy `~/.zshrc` to `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_zshrc` [Source 3](https://computingforgeeks.com/chezmoi-manage-dotfiles-across-multiple-machines/).

## Step 4: Edit Dotfiles

You can edit the source state of a file with the `chezmoi edit` command. This will open the file in your default editor, where you can make changes and save them.

```bash
chezmoi edit ~/.zshrc
```

## Step 5: Apply Changes

Once you've made the necessary changes, you can apply them using the `chezmoi apply` command.

```bash
chezmoi apply
```

This command will make the necessary changes to your dotfiles to match the desired state [Source 3](https://computingforgeeks.com/chezmoi-manage-dotfiles-across-multiple-machines/).

## Step 6: Commit Changes to Local Git Repository

After applying the changes, you need to commit them to your local git repository. You can do this by opening a shell in the source directory, committing your changes, and then exiting.

```bash
chezmoi cd
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
exit
```

[Source 1](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/)

## Step 7: Push Changes to Bitbucket

The next step is to push your changes to a Bitbucket repository. First, create a new repository on Bitbucket. Then, add the Bitbucket repository as the remote origin and push your changes.

```bash
git remote add origin https://bitbucket.org/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
	git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `USERNAME` with your Bitbucket username and `REPOSITORY` with the name of your Bitbucket repository [Source 1](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/).

## Step 8: Use Chezmoi Across Multiple Machines

To use `chezmoi` across multiple machines, you need to initialize `chezmoi` with your Bitbucket repository on the other machines.

```bash
chezmoi init https://bitbucket.org/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

Again, replace `USERNAME` with your Bitbucket username and `REPOSITORY` with the name of your Bitbucket repository [Source 1](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/).

You can then use the `chezmoi diff` command to check what changes will be made to your home directory. If you're happy with the changes, run `chezmoi apply -v` to apply them. 

```bash
chezmoi diff
chezmoi apply -v
```

Yes, there are more steps if you wish to add more files to your `chezmoi` configuration. The process of adding more files is virtually identical to the process of adding the initial files. 

To add more files, you'll use the `chezmoi add` command followed by the path to the file you want to add. Here's what that looks like:

```bash
chezmoi add ~/.myconfig
```

This command will copy the `~/.myconfig` file to the `~/.local/share/chezmoi` directory, which is where `chezmoi` stores its source state [Source 3](https://adrianvasile.dev/2023/01/12/dotfiles-using-chezmoi.html). 

After adding the file, you can make any necessary changes to it using the `chezmoi edit` command:

```bash
chezmoi edit ~/.myconfig
```

This command will open the file in your default editor, where you can make changes and save them [Source 1](https://jerrynsh.com/how-to-manage-dotfiles-with-chezmoi/). 

Once you're satisfied with your changes, use the `chezmoi diff` command to see what changes will be made when you apply your configuration:

```bash
chezmoi diff
```

If you're happy with the changes, use the `chezmoi apply` command to apply them:

```bash
chezmoi apply
```

This command will make the necessary changes to your dotfiles to match the desired state [Source 3](https://adrianvasile.dev/2023/01/12/dotfiles-using-chezmoi.html).

Finally, you'll want to commit your changes to your local git repository and push them to your Bitbucket repository. You can do this by opening a shell in the source directory, committing your changes, and then pushing them to Bitbucket:

```bash
chezmoi cd
git add .
git commit -m "Added myconfig"
git push
exit
```

This sequence of commands will commit your changes and push them to your Bitbucket repository [Source 1](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/). 

You can repeat this process for any additional files you wish to add to your `chezmoi` configuration.
## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily set up `chezmoi` and push your configuration files to a Bitbucket repository to share them across multiple systems. `chezmoi` is a powerful tool for managing your dotfiles, and it offers many features that can help you manage your personal configuration files securely and
