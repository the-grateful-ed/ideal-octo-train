Hello! I'm a 38-year-old web security specialist in training, currently residing on the West Coast of the United States. I'm deeply passionate about cybersecurity and the ever-evolving landscape of computer programming. I'm currently studying three exciting languages: Javascript, Rust, and Solidity.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I'm an avid fan of music, particularly rap and dubstep. I believe that these genres not only provide a unique aesthetic experience but also inspire creativity and innovation in various fields, including technology.

I'm married to the beautiful Dawn, who is my biggest supporter and inspiration. We share a love for adventure and exploration, which often finds us exploring new places, cuisines, and experiences.

In my journey to becoming a web security specialist, I'm constantly learning and
adapting to the ever-changing technological landscape. I'm particularly interested
in the intersection of technology and society, and how we can use technology to build
a more secure and equitable future.

In my free time, you can find me immersed in the world of music, whether it's attending
a live concert, discovering new artists, or creating my own beats. I also enjoy exploring
the great outdoors, hiking, and photography.

I'm excited to share my journey with you on this website. Stay tuned for updates on my studies, projects, and adventures!
